            Please, make sure to put `pygkls*.so` in the Python package directory and `libpygkls.{so, dylib}` in the dinamyc library directory.
            > [!WARNING]  
            > To use pyGKLS in Jupyter notebooks, it seems that one needs to put the shared library (`libpygkls.{so|dylib}`) in the global library path (e.g. `/usr/local/lib`), or to create a symbolic link. One can also put the shared library in the same directory as the notebook.
